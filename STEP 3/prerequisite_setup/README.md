# STEP 3.1: Prerequisite Setup for MongoDB

This guide covers the initial prerequisites for setting up MongoDB, which will serve as the vector database for our chatbot application. Here, you will create a cloud database account and install a tool to manage it.

## Part 1: Create a MongoDB Atlas Account

MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service that offers a generous free tier, perfect for this Proof of Concept.

1.  **Navigate to the Signup Page**:
    *   Open your web browser and go to the [MongoDB Atlas Cloud registration page](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register).

2.  **Register Your Account**:
    *   You can sign up with your Google account for a faster process or fill out the form with your details (name, email, password).

3.  **Create Your First Cluster**:
    *   After registration, you will be guided through creating your first database "cluster".
    *   Choose the **M0 Free Tier**. This is a shared-CPU instance with 512 MB of storage, which is more than enough for our needs and costs nothing.
    *   Select a cloud provider and region that is geographically closest to you for the best performance (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure in a region like `us-east-1`).
    *   You can leave the additional settings as default. Give your cluster a name if you wish (e.g., `chatbot-poc-cluster`).
    *   Click **"Create Cluster"**. It will take a few minutes for your new database to be provisioned and deployed.

4.  **Configure Database Access and Network Security**:
    *   While the cluster is deploying, you will be prompted to create a database user and set up network access.
    *   **Create a Database User**: Enter a new username and password. **Save these credentials securely**, as you will need them to connect to your database later. A good practice is to use a password manager.
    *   **Set Network Access**: For this POC, the simplest method is to allow access from anywhere. Select **"Allow Access from Anywhere"** (IP address `0.0.0.0/0`).
        *   *Note: For a real-world application, you would restrict this to specific IP addresses for security.* 
    *   Click **"Finish and Close"**.

## Part 2: Download and Install MongoDB Compass

Mongodb Compass is the official graphical user interface (GUI) for MongoDB. It allows you to visualize, query, and manage your database without writing commands in a terminal.

1.  **Go to the Download Page**:
    *   Visit the [MongoDB Compass Download Page](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass).

2.  **Download the Correct Version**:
    *   The website should automatically detect your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
    *   Ensure the correct version is selected and click the **"Download"** button.

3.  **Install MongoDB Compass**:
    *   Once the download is complete, run the installer.
    *   Follow the on-screen instructions. The default settings are fine for most users.

## âœ… Next Steps

Once you have successfully created your MongoDB Atlas account, deployed your free cluster, and installed MongoDB Compass, you are ready for the next phase: connecting to the database and setting up the specific collections and indexes needed for our application.
